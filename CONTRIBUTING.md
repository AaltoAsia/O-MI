## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that you have a good test coverage for the new component (at least 70% if you have new code or if fixing a bug, a test to detect the bug)
2. Make the pull request against `development` branch, unless you are making a new release in the pull request as well (see [Releasing instructions](https://github.com/AaltoAsia/O-MI/blob/master/docs/ReleasingAndBranches.md) or your contribution only doesn't contain any O-MI-Node sorce code modifications, such as documentation.
3. Wait for someone to review the pull request and fix any issues found.
4. After accepted, someone with rights may merge the pull request.
